# Sound Assets

## timer.wav

Add a timer completion sound here. The file should be named `timer.wav`.

You can use any short notification sound. Some options:
- Generate one at https://sfxr.me/
- Use a royalty-free sound from https://freesound.org/
- Convert an existing mp3/m4a to wav using: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 timer.wav`

The sound is used by the cooking timer in the tools modal to alert users when their timer completes.
